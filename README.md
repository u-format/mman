i tried to make responsive connection between gmod dedicated server and flutter. actually its worked well for basic things like; changing map, restart, kicking players, sending console commands to server to execute and some client/player functions like
freeze, kill, ban and kick. eventually i made this for proof-of-concept and to improve my http post/get knowledge. this project has no bounds if you know some lua and dart, you can do anything you want for your gmod server. you can even make a controller for npcs or players, its up to your imagination!
